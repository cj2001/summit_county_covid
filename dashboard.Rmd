Some notes about this data...

- __This dashboard is not intended to provide medical advice!__  If you have questions about your symptoms, please consult with a physician.

- __This dashboard is not intended to provide conclusions!__  If you want to draw conclusions on what you see here, that is up to you.

- The data herein have been obtained from the [New York Times Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv), which is updated daily and available for free download.

- The data might not be updated over the weekend, or the counts might be artificially low due to less staff at the labs over the weekends.

- I am maintaining this dashboard on my own and through no assistance or funding. It is open source and anyone is free to download it [here](https://github.com/cj2001/summit_county_covid).  Note that I have yet to add in automated updating, so this is still a manual process.

- For any questions about this dashboard, please contact @cjisalock on Twitter (keep it respectful or you will be blocked!).
