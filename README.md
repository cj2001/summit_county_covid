# Ski Country, CO COVID-19 Dashboard

I had originally created this dashboard to show the data for Summit County, CO.  However, I have updated it now to show 6 different counties:

- Eagle, CO (Vail)
- Grand, CO (Winter Park)
- Gunnison, CO (Crested Butte)
- San Miguel, CO (Telluride)
- Pitkin, CO (Aspen Mountain, Aspen Highlands, Snowmass, Buttermilk)
- Summit, CO (Breckenridge, Keystone, Copper, Arapahoe Basin)

I am getting my data the NY Times dataset which can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv).  It uses Shiny and the visualizations are presently hosted publicly at [https://cj2001.shinyapps.io/ski_country_covid_dashboard](https://cj2001.shinyapps.io/ski_country_covid_dashboard).  It does not yet automatically update with the daily numbers (I do that bit manually and try to do it daily), but I hope to add that in soon.
