# Summit County, CO COVID-19 Dashboard

I created this dashboard because I wanted to know things that were not being captured by the government in my home area.  I am getting my data from the NY Times dataset which can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv).  It uses Shiny and the visualizations are presently hosted publicly at [https://cj2001.shinyapps.io/summit_covid_dashboard](https://cj2001.shinyapps.io/summit_covid_dashboard).  It does not yet automatically update with the daily numbers, but I hope to add that in soon.
